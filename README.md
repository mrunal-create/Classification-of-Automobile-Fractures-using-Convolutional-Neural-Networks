# Classification-of-Automobile-Fractures-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
•	An algorithm was designed using Convolutional Neural Networks which classified the micrographs  of failed automotive components into three categories namely fragile, ductile and brittle. The program gave an accuracy of 90.02% .
•	Used Early stopping in Keras to stop training as soon as the validation error reaches minimum.
•	This project was implemented at Smart India Hackathon 2019 Grand Finale for the company ARAI, Pune.
